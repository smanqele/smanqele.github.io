### **About Me**

I am Sihle Manqele, founder and chief architect at ImvunoTech ("Imvuno"). I consider my focus to be fuelled more by entrepreneurial ambitions than ever before in my technical experience as a Software Developer. While I have been enjoying the technical deep dives of various kinds and in different contexts, there is a better appreciation for building systems that solve real problems and/ create opportunities at a startup level and for various types of domains.

### **My Interests**

One of the domains I am highly interested in is Agriculture, within the African context. This is a thriving sector in Africa, but it is besieged by many production issues that often cause big losses, some anticipated (for example bad road infrastructure causing delays) and some not (infections that affect crops or livestock). I am also interested in improving the efficiencies in these operations, like better water management or crop rotation strategies. Hemp farming seems to be exciting to many in the West, especially the by-product of that process being value added products like hempcrete and other products in cosmetics or food production. A lot of these capabilities can bring added employment and add to a country's fiscus. I am pushing for a "Hemp Growers' Association" within the African context to have this awareness and to find training that can help to realise these ideals, preferably with the help of business incubators.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been at the forefront of this thinking, and I am here appealing to visionaries or potential future investors to help me accomplish some productive concepts that I need to build products for. I discuss some of these concepts in my blog posts here.

### **My Family**

I am a husband, and father who grew up on the sunny coast of Durban, Kwa-Zulu Natal. I enjoy instilling thoughtfulness in my boys by playing chess and other mind games. My lovely wife and our boys are the ones helping me re-discover a voice I thought I never had as a boy growing under the Apartheid system in South Africa.

### **Life in the Netherlands**

I am based in a lovely and welcoming North Brabant city of Eindhoven, in the Netherlands. I really did not know what to expect from the Netherlands communities as I arrived out of a necessity to make a living. I consult on behalf of Luxoft using my Application engineering knowledge. I put simplicity as a focus to my approach in everything I do.

### **Overall**

I am friendly, approachable and spiritually driven. I have developed an inkling for content creation, and I would appreciate your feedback on my material.
